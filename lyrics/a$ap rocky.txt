I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hangTransition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard,
cheffin' like I'm Boyar—Dee,
probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
my la familia go hardDown to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed, then I bogart,
any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects
with a skateboardI roll past and I blaze y'all
like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P.,
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to,
I might slice my wristOr pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious,
talkin' to my conscienceGettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'anceUnfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with JiggaAnd I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck itPainter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be inTrouble to body-double or couple me to these others

Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was frozeAnd thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous,
aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
ostrich's posh shit
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with meNow many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
Red roses dropped from boxes very oftenConfetti torchin',
drinkin' Henny
like I'm Kenny LoftonOutstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
You see me comin' through in each stateJust so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wackAll I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win isThe aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' shipsChokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag,
poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass
That's out of line, but in livin' color?I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artistFlexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
You'd think I'm jumpin' out the window how I got 'em open
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer
Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard
I listened to X, I peeped the bars The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
I waited in line, return, refineThe new design, it's time to shineTo shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greazeThese niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze

Burnin' planes in my Air Force

See this what that voice in your head saysWhen you try to get peace of mind"I gotta find peace of mind"
"I gotta find peace of mind"
"I gotta find peace of mind"
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured,
pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands outGot they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer
I rewind, Nas track 6,
rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes senseJust like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glassPour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omeletMy earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suitesTook out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth,
chewing on nothingYou're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone
"I gotta find peace of mind"
"I gotta find peace of mind"
"I gotta find peace of mind"
"I gotta find peace of mind"
"I gotta find peace of mind"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me""You make my desire pure, just tell me"

Can't cope when your heart brokeSoft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro
Two of everything, should have been to blame
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closedFace-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speakNot a call or visit in weeksLost nothin' since SeptemberLast seen her September '16Man it feels like
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me Press is gone and I grief
