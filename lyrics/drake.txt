Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'DomeI need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful movesI was an angry yute while I was writin’ ViewsSaw a side of myself that I just never knewI’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel walletShe knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about itNowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about itCan't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at nightWakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nightsBut you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six daysNever stick around to see shit change

If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with meYou overnight celebrity, you one day starSwear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternityI am a reflection of all of your insecuritiesBehind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshippingDone talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around meI want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dawg, but his grandmother's his suretyHe can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recoveryMaybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble meI'll be back 2018 to give you the summary
More LifeIt's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with NebbyAnd I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavyAnd I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshitAnd you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push itNow it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeatAnd I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorryAnd you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does tooAnd it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uhMaybe I should walk up the streetAnd try and get a job at the bank'Cause leave it up to me, J, and NeeksWe'll probably end up robbin' a bank

I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrapYou exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kingsThey turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgeryRah took you to her doc, but you don't look like RahLeft the operating table, still look like "nah"
I took the price, and lift that bitch upI took the ice, let me lift my wrist upI took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch upI took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraudWhy do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrrBut they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"Man, please stop bringin' up my pastI'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wineWhich is funny because I just saw Nick the other dayAnd she keeps getting finer over time
I took the price, and lift that bitch upI took the ice, let me lift my wrist upI took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch upI took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in DallasWho you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the backStadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it firstIt's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
People like Mazin who was a best friend to meStart to become a distant memoryThings change in that life, and this life started lacking synergyAnd fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boysBut you gotta understand when it's yoursThey don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

How you feel about?Now let me see ya prove itJust let me see ya prove it
The Pulitzer Prize winner is definitely spiralin'
I got your fucking lines tapped, I swear that I'm dialed in
First, I was a rat, so where's the proof of the trial then?Where's the paperwork or the cabinet it's filed in?1090 Jake woulda took all the walls downThe streets woulda had me hidin' out in a small town
My Montreal connects stand up, now fall down
The ones that you're getting your stories from, they all clowns
I am a war general sеasoned in preparationMy jacket is covеred in medals, honor and decoration
You waited for this moment, overcome with the desperation
We plotted for a week, and then we fed you the informationA daughter that's eleven years old, I bet he takes itWe thought about givin' a fake name or a destinationBut you so thirsty, you not concerned with investigationInstead you in that Venice studio, it's a celebrationYou gotta learn to fact-check things and be less impatientYour fans are rejoicin' thinkin' this is my expirationEven the picture you used, the jokes, and the medicationThe Maybach glove and the drug he use is for less inflationMaster manipulator, you bit on the speculationYou dumb and reactive, nigga, I'm petty with dedication
What about the bones we dug up in that excavation?And why isn't Whitney denyin' all of the allegations?Why is she followin' Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?
You haven't seen the kids in six months, the distance is wild
Dave leavin' heart emojis underneath pics of the child
Speakin' of anything with a child, let's get to that nowThis Epstein angle was the shit I expectedTikTok videos you collected and dissectedInstead of bein' on some diss-direct shitYou rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit
My mom came over today, and I was like, "Mother, I—Mother, I—, mother—," ahh, wait a secondThat's that one record where you say you got molestedAw, fuck me, I just made the whole connectionThis about to get so depressin'This is trauma from your own confessionsThis when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglectedThat's why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive
They actin' like it's so aggressive, but you just never known affectionI don't wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessin'
"Touch My Body" by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin'
I never been with no one underage, but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess withJust for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respectedIf I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrestedI'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested
But that's not the lesson, clearly, there's a deeper messageDeep cuts that never healed, and now they got infected
Like if Dave really fucked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin' resentmentI'm not sure how to ease the sentiment, this shit's too intimateI'm praying you recover from both incidents
But you a piece of shit, so this shit really no coincidence
Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It
You mentionin' A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, "Who was it?"
You thought you left D flat, D major
I'll slit your throat with the razorAnd do Rick Ross Air like that one flight from Malaysia
I'm your baby mama's screen saver
Only fuckin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager
I'm a fucking hitmaker, dog, not a peacemaker
Yeah, bullets that I'm stuffin' in each chamber, your ass in extreme danger
Stop buyin' views and bot comments,
you may as well keep the paperShit you 'bout to need for laterI give a fuck about your streamin' data
You could drop a hundred more records, I'll see you later
Yeah, maybe when you meet your maker
I don't wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature
If you still bumpin' R. Kelly, you could thank the SaviorSaid if they deleted his music, then your music is goin' too, a hypocrite
I don't understand why these people praise yaSoundin' like you send him commissary when he need some paper
Album droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doin' hard labor
Nigga, I'll see you when I see you like Fantasia
And Whitney, you can hit me if you need a favorAnd when I say I hit ya back, it's a lot saferHuh, I promise
I'm not gonna lie, this shit was some, some good exercise, likeIt's good to get out, get the pen workin'
You would be a worthy competitor if I was really a predatorAnd you weren't fuckin' lying to every blogger and editor, butIt is what it is
You definitely got this shit burnt the fuck out though, likeYou got ten more records to dropThe one before the last one, we finessed you into tellin' a story that doesn't even existAnd then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up
I would like that one, that w—, that-that would be some shit I could dance to if you wasn'tTriplin' down on some whole other bullshit, but
You know, at least your fans are gettin' some raps out of youI'm happy I could motivate youBring you back to the game, like
You know, butJust let me know when we're gettin' to the factsEverything in my shit is factsI'm waitin' on you to return the favor, likeI'm in shockThe nerve, the audacityOkay
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of VsWhat do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?I've done things for him I thought that he never would needFather had to stretch his hands out and get it from meI pop style for 30 hours then let him repeatNow you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eatKeep gettin' temperature checksThey know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beamY'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge thoseBut I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circleAnd hold him back 'cause he makes me nervousI wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purposeYou niggas leeches and serpentsI think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then youSo, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knewDon't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you doThere's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and MercedesBut you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature fadedI think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple timesNigga was at Kroger workin' double timeY'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hitsBut then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did itMy spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my nameAnd I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelingsIt's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to youConsiderin' that we just sold another 20 for you
To be honestDuppyIn my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about herIs it the strength of your feelingsOverthrowing your pain?You'll see new heights you’ll be reachingAnd is it today that you will find your new release?And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtopSo watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paidYou couldn't buy the real thingI was stayin’ up at yo' placeTryin' to figure out the whole thingI saw people doin' thingsAlmost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled nowMore life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tappedAll that yappin' on the phone shitYou must really love the road lifeAll that never comin' home shit

The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worseTheir actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the braveI gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas pavedAnd they don't like that, it's written all on they face

I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit itThink that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culpritThem strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effortI piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials,
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for nowJust give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from nowThat's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora
and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mindThe difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid meNow real nigga, wassup?Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get thereAre you enjoyin' yourselves?If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirationalHopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many yearsIt don't mean that we can't have a good lifeSo we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us"There's three balls and a strikeHere's the pitchIt's belted deep to centerRevere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"
At least we try for home run every time
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Wish you would learn to love people and use thingsAnd not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging

Publicly she at the crib again, company
I'm outside , 29, G5 , Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace But honestly that sound like a fair trade to meIf I ever heard one and I'm still hereOutside, Frontline, Southside I've been losin' friends and findin' peace Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
I don't understand why you blame meJust take me as I am, it's the same meWe should be, senseless sight to seeSenseless sight to seeUp on a mountain Search through the valley You hear me calling Won't you come find me? Please don't forsake me All of a sudden My heart is breaking I feel it coming, I, IIt's a little chilly out thereHow you can stand there is beyond me
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closerMuch closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family forCause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've beenEver since you met meLike when Chrysler made that one carThat looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've beenAnd even when it's business with you it's personal againI knew you before you made ends meetAnd now we're meeting our end
And it's all because you chose a sideYou're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for meGuess it wasn't time And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like youKennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belongOut here in L.A., I don't know what's going on I don't know what's going on
And it's all because you chose a sideYou're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for meGuess it wasn't time And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars alignMy luck is a sure thing cause I'm living rightWhen I needed you, you couldn't give me any adviceBut you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the wayI'm fooding and serving them allLike I'm working minimum wageSomeone up there must just love testing my patienceSomeone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your waysIf I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raisedSame way I'm right here still feeling the waySame way I'm realizing on a day to day that
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closerMuch closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family forCause I can't depend on you anymoreMuch closer

Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Some nights I wish I could go back in lifeNot to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in VibeThat's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it insideOh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stageYou need to act your age and not your girl's age
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attentionI remember when it used to be music that did it
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up withI'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck withIf me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions onBut here we are, yeah
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve

"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go

I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheeseSpecial order for anybody that's comin' for me
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
