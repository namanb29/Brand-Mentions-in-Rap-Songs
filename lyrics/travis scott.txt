You are all unwelcome to Sin City
To complicate your simplicityNo matter your ethnicityAll for the sake of publicity, in this city
I'm in the loop, boy I'm tied like an ascot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on yaWell I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is and he never hung with the saintsIt makes no sense to save the righteous
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sinsGod bless the city, amen
Here is where her heart belongsHer heart belongs with meHere is where her heartI'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongsIt should be here with me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to rightAnd wrote some songs I wouldn't dare reciteBut I am willing to share tonightIn the city that is as unfair as life
