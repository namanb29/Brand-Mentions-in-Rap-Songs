Man, I promise, she's so self-consciousShe has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no moneyBut she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrThe concept of school seems so securrSophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurrShe like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairsOf new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressureCouldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weaveThen she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believeSingle black female addicted to retail, and well

The prettiest people do the ugliest thingsFor the road to riches and diamond rings

Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crackAnd the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou''Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'Before I had a house and I'd do it again

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurpThat right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light supportTellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feelOn the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wallFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it allThrough the fire, through whatever, come what mayFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the wayRight down to the wire, even through the fire
I really apologize for everything right nowIf it's unclear at all, man

But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wallFor a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it allThrough the fire, through whatever, come what mayFor a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the wayRight down to the wire, even through the fire
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, umThat I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, "Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, manThe most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing youI contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myselfAnd I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murderYou'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Just say it out loud to see how it feelsPeople say "don't say this, don't say that"Just say it out loud, just to see how it feelsWeigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myselfAnd I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off badBut sometimes I think really bad thingsReally, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love youSee, if I was tryin' to relate it to more peopleI'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myselfBecause that seems like a common themeBut that's not the case hereI love myself way more than I love youAnd I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you todayPremeditated murder
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongueI don't joke with no one, they'll say "He died so young"
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last nameIt's a different type of rules that we obey

Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay

I thought I was past my Deebo ways

How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way backTo when I had the braids and you had the wave capDrop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape All you gotta do is speak on YeAll you gotta do is speak on YeDon't get your tooth chipped like Frito-LayShe don't believe in shootin' starsBut she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
I met this girl when I was three years oldAnd what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, butMy name is Windy and I like to blow trees," andFrom that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her offThey like to act tough, she like to tow 'em offAnd make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtownIn the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"
I'm comin' home againDo you think about me now and then?Do you think about me now and then?'Cause I'm comin' home again-Min' home againDo you think about me now and then?Do you think about me now and then? Oh!Now I'm comin' home again
But if you really cared for herThen you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreamsSometimes I still talk to herBut when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like youThey wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you," and I just got throughTalkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrongI guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home

Brains, power, and muscleLike Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forthJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"
I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game.
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty.
I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.
And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't Be Life."
And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take
One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to......Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up......I unpacked all my shit.
I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City."
And Beans was still working on his album at that time
so I came up there to Baseline,
And Hip-hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And
really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.'
Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?
Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats"
I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know.
And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, "Man that was tight."
So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single.
My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that.
And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's
So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever.
Everybody out there listen here: I played them "Jesus Walks" and they didn't sign me.
You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, "Naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me,
The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad
So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wowI got 11 plaques on my walls right nowYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him
and he's like "oh shit""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know
So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."
Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer-rapper,"
I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"Uh, uhUh, uh

You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?I don't feel that she's mine enough

They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, Ye?"Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it allHad to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimentalYou know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George JetsonBut soundin' like George JeffersonThen they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts againThen I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphereI use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after hereI live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to beEven if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries

Baby girl tryna get a nutAnd her girl tryna give it upChopped 'em both down

One last announcementNo sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That's when David Grutman kicked her outBut I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' meLike if Tyler Perry made a movie for BETSearchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on meI start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-AClosed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A

When I go to work, she gotta call it inShe can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Yeezus just rose again
We can send this bitch up, it can go downWe can send this bitch up, it can go downWe can send this bitch up, it can go downWe can send this bitch up, it can go down

Pour the lean out slowerGot us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judgeThey did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on MondayBut the strong start on Sunday

If you woke, then wake upWith Judas, kiss and make upEven with the bitter cupForgave my brothers and drank upDid everything but gave upStab my back, I can't frontStill we win, we prayed upEven when we die, we raise up
The powers that be done been greedyWe need ours by this eveningNo white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the toolsWe got the minds, we got the youthWe goin' wild, we on the loosePeople is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in LukeThe army of God and we are the truth'Cause we been out the wavе catchin' wavesThey say, "We ain't seen you on thе block"'Cause I been out the wayChasin' millions in my sleep, I found the better way
Way too many fallen soldiers, no, I can't forgotHope they got headphones up in Heaven
Kanye and Jay still brothers, they both billionaires
And we ain't see it, I lost my brother when we was millionaires
I wasn't scared to die, but him, that was my biggest fear
I got your son and your daughter like you still here
Know how it feel to lose a brother, we got a bond still
Twenty-six years, pops got out to see his son killed
Died with his chain on, I call it blood diamonds
It's to the point I drop my own lo' so they could find usAnd it's been months and they still hidin’
Kanye did it for the city, he co-signed
Smoke a opp pack ain't funny like thatIt get ugly like that, can't get no money like that
Holy Father, please, let me step inCan't talk to buddy like that, it get bloody like that
And when you text, change the beginnin' of every wordYou will speak to me with only no cap
Me and your big homie go backAnd homie don't rap, you don't know me like thatWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I foundOh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get downGet up, I get down, get up, I get downGet up, I get down, get up, I get down
Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the startI seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbonsI seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hotAnd when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-givenThis is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rapI'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I foundOh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get downGet up, I get down, get up, I get downGet up, I get down, get up
I get down for my grandfather
who took my mommaMade her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eatAt the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-insAnd with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadershipBut we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbedSwear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paidIt's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed awaySo I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye'Cause look what an accident did to Left EyeFirst Aaliyah, now Romeo must dieI know I got angels watching me from the other side
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I foundOh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get downGet up, I get down, get up, I get downGet up, I get down, get up, I get down
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn seriousThat's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from HimSo it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrumentMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop
that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivationI'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self downIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riffAnd you slipped off the side and clinched on to your lifeIn my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are foundLet it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called loveThat's why my breath is felt by the deafAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blindI, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouthA touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I foundOh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I getGet up, I get, get up, I getGet up, I get, get up, I get down

I'd play my little songs in that old back roomHe'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by The Black Album, I was blacking outPartyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" butNot only did I not get a chance to spit itCarline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little differentAnd kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogusOnly made me more focused, only wrote more potent

Sibling rivalry, only I could seeIt was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, "I inspired me"But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunkAnd my shit was more like a finger roll
I told Jay I did a song with ColdplayNext thing I know he got a song with ColdplayBack in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way"
Then I went and told Jay BrownShoulda known that was gon' come back aroundShoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you firstBut I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
"Does he write his own rhymes?" Well, sort of, I think 'emThat mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford EscortOr even a four-track recorderSo it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top PorscheSpoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many menThen your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions

Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be stillEverybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store

And then his son told me "Put down the drink dawg"
I guess there's nothin' and I'm finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, my life sucks
Stomping on someone, with my boots
And every other god need a goddess

It falls upon something that's inside us
Tell me where my ride is
And I don't like them, and they don't like thatThey don't like that, and I don't want that
