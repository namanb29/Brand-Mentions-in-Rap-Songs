Last night I had thirty-two teeth in my mouthSome went away
Why'd you have to go and fucking ruin my day?
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
But you're the only way to drown my sadness
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
I was laid out flat like a centerfold
Jakey and his partner drove me home
Lookin' in the mirror, something's wrongLеt me get my dentist on thе phone
I took a shot, took a shot, took a shot, took another shot
Fell right out my fuckin' chair, swingin' for his eyeThen a big chrome ring flew in from the sideI thought I died
You're the reason why I got my ass kicked
But you're the only way to drown my sadness
You're the reason why I got my ass kickedAnd I really really hit the Palisades right now
Supreme on my back and I'm whippin' the woo
Man, I poke another hole, I smoke another OAnd I pour another O and I smoke another, smoke another
Pull up on Fairfax, drop top Hop out into the 'preme store, top notchAlready bread jumpin' out the pockets
My bitch started cryin', I bought her a Shih Tzu
Broke niggas call me materialistic We do not ball the same, you're still learnin' how to pivot
Leave the mall, leave a trail of tears
If he ever feels down, we can take off in the LearI live my life so overtired
I could be more like him if that's cool to youI'd do anything to be cool to youCool to you
I'd remove my tattoos if that's cool to you
I could end it with her if that's cool to youTen billion cuties that think I'm the manBut if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand
You weren’t impressed by all the ice on my fingers I had your mom and daddy’s house on my pinky
If I'da known what it’d be like nowI wouldn't be in misery right now
Look in the mirror, I don't see myselfBeing with me has gotta be like hellSo tell the devil I'ma be right downKilos de música de Medellín a MonterreyDon't wanna sober upThe sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourningThought I was strong enoughThrew my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"
Don't wanna sober upTry to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour itThought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
I just left Wally's, spent a MaseratiThe way I gotta flex, you'd think I did PilatesI call my quote-unquote friends, "Do you got plans?"Turns out everyone's free when the dinner isThen they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty coolTried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shootBye-bye
Don't wanna sober upThe sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourningThought I was strong enoughThrew my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning
Don't wanna sober upTry to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour itThought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
Throwin' up is easy and who put on the Commodores?
That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more
Who am I talkin' to? NobodyTake me outside, I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my lifeWhen money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'
Don't wanna sober upThe sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourningThought I was strong enoughThrew my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"
Don't wanna sober upTry to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour itThought I was strong enough
